## Description
The HVPT (high variability phonetic training) Portal is an application for language learning students to practice a new language through exercises that expose them to a variety of speakers. Student users create an account, which displays their language courses, modules & activities. Each activity contains a series of 'questions' where students will hear a sound clip of a word in another language, and then select the answer that matches the sound they just heard.
